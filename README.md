# Achaea-Simple-Nexus-Party-Autotargetter
Created July 24, 2017. This is a fairly simple party autotargetter for Nexus client users of Achaea as of this date.

Here's some information about the package contents so you know what aliases and Nexus variables were added to your experience. Also so they're easier to find in case you need to change them.

These are the following variables created and used by the autotargetter:
  -pLeader
  -partyReporting
  
Aliases created and used by the autotargetter are:
  -st <target>     (Overrides the serverside st to set targets but functions much the same)
  -spl <person>    (Sets the party leader, aka the person calling targets who you're going to follow)
  -cpl             (Clears the party leader by setting it to none. The same effect can be achieved by doing 'spl none')
  -pon             (Enables party target reporting. Will echo to the party that you're 'Now targetting' whomever the party leader targets)
  -po              (Disables party target reporting)
  
* * As an extra note, the 'pon' alias will make the 'st' alias send 'Target <target>' when you use it to manually target as 'st' assumes you're the party leader.

That's about it. This was created to help Ashtani novices on the Nexus client but feel free to spread it around. Not the best thing around but hey, it works and should be pretty easy to edit. Please let me know if there are any problems and feel free to shoot me questions through an OOC message to Chubbs or on discord to FangFang if you're in the server. Hope this helps you out a little if you choose to use it.
